## Welcome to GitHub Pages
Android apps are a great way to make our life easier and flexible. 
Google's got a lot of apps. Maybe even too many, in certain cases.
Here I am giving some examples of some apps :-----
1. Google Handwriting Input
2. Trusted Contacts
3. Google Trips. 
4. Google Arts & Culture. 
5. Chrome Remote Desktop. 
6. Google Opinion Rewards. 
7. Android Auto. 
8. Wallpapers. 


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/robotjellyzone/Robotjellyandroid.github.-io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/robotjellyzone/Robotjellyandroid.github.-io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
